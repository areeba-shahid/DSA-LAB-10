Projects
1. Plagiarism Detection App
Plagiarism detection is a fundamental task in text processing, useful for identifying copied content in documents. This project involves creating a system that detects similarities between two or more text files.

Approach:
Use string matching techniques (e.g., Jaccard Similarity, Cosine Similarity) to measure the similarity between text files.
Extract features such as common n-grams or word frequency to represent the documents.
Use techniques such as MinHash or Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for efficient similarity detection.
Key Concepts:
Tokenization: Breaking text into words or phrases.
Feature Extraction: Converting text to numerical representations like TF-IDF.
Similarity Measurement: Calculating how similar two texts are using various distance metrics.
2. Crossword Solver
The crossword solver helps automate the process of solving crosswords by filling in the blanks based on the provided clues and a dictionary.

Approach:
Represent the crossword puzzle as a grid (matrix) where clues correspond to either rows or columns.
Use a backtracking algorithm to attempt placing words in the grid.
Check each placement of a word against a dictionary to ensure validity.
Optimize the solution by focusing on more constrained positions (such as smaller words).
Key Concepts:
Backtracking: A recursive approach for building possible solutions and undoing invalid steps.
Constraint Propagation: Reducing possibilities by considering intersecting words.
Trie Data Structure: Efficient lookup of dictionary words.
3. Travel Planner Using Graphs
This project involves finding the optimal travel route between multiple cities, considering factors like distance, time, and cost.

Approach:
Represent cities and connections as a graph where cities are nodes and roads/flights are edges with weights.
Use graph algorithms such as Dijkstra’s Algorithm for finding the shortest path between two cities.
For multiple cities, consider solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using approximation algorithms like Greedy Algorithm or Simulated Annealing.
Key Concepts:
Graph Theory: Representation and traversal of graphs.
Shortest Path Algorithms: Finding the shortest or least-cost path in a graph.
Optimization: Solving the TSP using various heuristics and approximation algorithms.
4. Cash Flow Minimizer
In this project, we aim to minimize the number of transactions between a group of people while ensuring that all debts are paid.

Approach:
Represent cash flow between people as a graph where nodes represent people and edges represent debts (with amounts).
Use algorithms to minimize the transactions by merging or offsetting debts between individuals.
Apply Graph Algorithms and Flow Networks to efficiently balance the amounts between people and reduce the number of transactions required to settle debts.
Key Concepts:
Flow Networks: Modeling the flow of money and optimizing the flow to minimize transactions.
Graph Simplification: Merging debts and reducing the number of transactions.
Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python, C++, or Java.
Libraries: For Plagiarism Detection: sklearn (for text feature extraction), numpy, nltk (for natural language processing).
For Crossword Solver: Backtracking algorithm, wordlist (or predefined dictionary).
For Travel Planner: Graph libraries like networkx in Python, Dijkstra’s algorithm, TSP solvers.
For Cash Flow Minimizer: Graph theory algorithms, flow network optimizations.
